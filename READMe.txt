Guided Analysis on Bar Coupon Results:
- The analysis performed in the project allowed us to make several important conclusions
- In the guided analysis of bar coupon responses, we came away with several possible hypotheses
- It appears that individuals who already go to the bar at least once are much more likely to accept bar coupons
- Individuals above 25, individuals above 30, and individuals with companions who aren't kids are all subsets of respondants who appear significantly more likely to accept bar coupons.
    - These all fit demographics that are intuitively more likely to visit a bar, given they are of age to drink alcohol.
- Individuals who do not visit the bar frequently (<1 a month) are much less likely to accept bar coupons, reflecting a consistent lack of desire to attend the bar.
- Individuals who have kids with them in their car are much less likely to accept bar coupons. Customers with kids accompanying are likely unable to attend the bar.


Individual analysis problem statement: Can we find patterns in subsets of data related to the coffee house coupons?
In particular, can we find trends related to income, age, and frequency of coffee house visits?

Results:
- Interestingly, income affected rate of acceptance:
    - A majority of lower income bracket respondents accepted coffee house coupons
    - A minority of upper income bracket respondents accepted coffee house coupons
    - Overall, there was a small increase (about 11%) in likelihood for acceptance if participants were in lower income brackets, reflecting the relative utility of a coupon to lower income customers.
- Age was another factor in rate of acceptance:
    - A majority of younger participants (younger than 30 years old) accepted coffee house coupons
    - A minority of older participants (30 or older) accepted coffee house coupons
    - Overall, younger participants were slightly more likely (about 14%) to accept coupons than older participants.
    - Factors like interest in coffee, utility of coffee based on age, or free time based on age could have led to these results.
- The greatest factor in rate of acceptance was frequency of attending coffee houses in a month:
    - Individuals who attended coffee houses frequent (4 or more times a month) were vastly more likely (a 50% difference!) than infrequent (less than 4 a month) attenders to accept the coupon.
    - While unsurprising, this affect demonstrates the reliability of targeting coupon services to customers who display a tendency to attend a certain venue.
    - In this case, we can conclude that individuals who already attend coffee houses frequently are very likely to accept coffee house coupons!


Further recommendations are included in the notebook. They include:
- Finding statistical data on the "disposable income" of given income bracket participants in order to hone in on possible trends in coupon acceptance based on income.
- Survey of factors like "free time" or relative interest or utility of coffee of participants, perhaps in relation to age, as it may allow for further analysis of coupon acceptance rates.
