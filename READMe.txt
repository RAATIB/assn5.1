- The visualizations demonstrate frequency of coupon types, with coffee houses being the most common and expensive restaurants the least.
- Also notable in our visualization is the relative frequency of 80F respondents compared to other temperatures.


- The analysis performed in the project allowed us to make several important conclusions
- In the guided analysis of bar coupon responses, we came away with several possible hypotheses
- It appears that individuals who already go to the bar at least once are much more likely to accept bar coupons
- Individuals above 25, individuals above 30, and individuals with companions who aren't kids are all subsets of respondants who appear significantly more likely to accept bar coupons.
    - These all fit demographics that are intuitively more likely to visit a bar, given they are of age to drink alcohol.
- Individuals who do not visit the bar frequently (<1 a month) are much less likely to accept bar coupons, reflecting a consistent lack of desire to attend the bar.
- Individuals who have kids with them in their car are much less likely to accept bar coupons. Customers with kids accompanying are likely unable to attend the bar.


- I also performed individual analysis on the coffee house coupon responses. Specific values are featured in the Jupyter notebook!
- Interestingly, income affected rate of acceptance:
    - A majority of lower income bracket respondents accepted coffee house coupons
    - A minority of upper income bracket respondents accepted coffee house coupons
    - Overall, there was a small increase in likelihood for acceptance if participants were in lower income brackets, reflecting the relative utility of a coupon to lower income customers.
- Age was another factor in rate of acceptance:
    - A majority of younger participants (younger than 30 years old) accepted coffee house coupons
    - A minority of older participants (30 or older) accepted coffee house coupons
    - Overall, younger participants were slightly more likely to accept coupons than older participants.
    - Factors like interest in coffee, utility of coffee based on age, or free time based on age could have led to these results.
- The greatest factor in rate of acceptance was frequency of attending coffee houses in a month:
    - Individuals who attended coffee houses frequent (4 or more times a month) were vastly more likely than infrequent (less than 4 a month) attenders to accept the coupon.
    - While unsurprising, this affect demonstrates the reliability of targeting coupon services to customers who display a tendency to attend a certain venue.
    - In this case, we can conclude that individuals who already attend coffee houses frequently are very likely to accept coffee house coupons!
- The project notebook includes suggestions on what further surveys may include in terms of questioning in order to hone in on details about potential coupon users based on observations!
